# Lab 8: Exam Review!

Given we don't have peer mentors this semester, it will be hard for us
to answer all exam review questions during lab, so here's how we'll
organize things to get the most out of it (this is a bit of an
experiment, so feel free to send Tyler suggestions for ways to run
review labs in the future):

1. you can't ask a TA a question during this lab unless you've joined a group of 4-6 students, and the group as a whole has decided to ask the question
2. each time the TA visits your group, the group gets to ask 1 question before rotating to the next group
3. between visits, the group should discuss potential questions to ask and pick the best one
4. see how many other questions can be answered by leveraging the collective knowledge of your group -- learn from each other!

We have a couple exercises for each section of the exam to help you review:

* [Reproducibility](reproducibility.md)
* [Complexity](complexity.md)
* [OOP](oop.md)
* [Trees](trees.md)
* [Graphs](graphs.md)
* [Web+Regex](web.md)
