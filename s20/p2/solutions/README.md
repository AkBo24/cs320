# Note on Publishing Code

Normally, you're not allowed to post your project solutions publicly
to GitHub we reuse projects and you can get in trouble if somebody
finds your work and uses parts of it in the future.  This is also why
we don't usually share our solutions.

This semester (Spring 2019), P2 is an exception.  We're retiring this
project after this semester, so for better or worse, this project was
a once in a lifetime experience.

Because it's being retired, you're welcome to share your bus.py on
your GitHub or elsewhere.  If you do, you may want to link to this
page so people know you're allowed to share the solutions and are not
helping others cheat.  If you like, you can also post your solution
directly to this repo.
